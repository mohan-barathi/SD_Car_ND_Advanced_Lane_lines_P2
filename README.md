The Project
---
*The goals / steps of this project are the following:*

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

The images used for camera calibration are in the folder called `camera_cal`.  The images in `test_images` are used for testing the pipeline on single frames.  

The `output_images` folder contains all the intermediate outputs of the pipeline, that were used for [writeup](./Writeup - Project 2.md)
